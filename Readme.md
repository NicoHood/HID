Arduino HID Project 2.6.0
=========================

![Header Picture](header.jpg)

This project went through a lot of phases and has now reached a new Arduino ~~USB-Core~~ Library
with a lot of new functions like extended HID. It also supports HoodLoader2 (version 1 is no longer supported).
The idea is to enable enhanced USB functions to almost all 'standard' Arduino boards.
